### Aspiring Software Engineer

I am currently a computer science student pursuing a Bachelor's degree. I started programming in 2020, and have since earned an Associate of Science degree. 

## List of Projects
### [Four In a Row Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/FourInARow)
I created a four-in-a-row game using React. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React, and how a user would be able to interact with the frontend. Since this was my first React project, most of my focus was on learning how it worked. This game allows for two players to choose spots on the board until a player gets four spots in a row. The code checks if a spot has already been filled, and doesn't allow a user to reuse the same spot. It checks for wins diagonally, vertically, and horizontally. Some of the technical challenges I had to overcome included figuring out how to use React to alternate between players.

### [Banking App](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Banking-App)
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create a website. This was a group project done for a software engineering class with @ashiggles and @anniecroft using the name "Team Gecko". The project is a mock banking website. Some of the technical challenges of this project included establishing communications between the client and server sides and creating events for when the user hits "submit".
Overall features of the website include:
+ login page
  - account verification
+ user account page
  - each account is associated with an id
  - accounts have different options depending on user's credentials
    * Administrators may change the rights associated with each account, access any page, create accounts, and have an account of their own
    * Employees may view customer accounts, create accounts, and have their own account
    * Customers may access only their own accounts
+ transaction history
  - users may view the history of their checking, savings, and deposit accounts
  - history includes a date and description of transaction
+ list of all accounts
  - only accessible to employees and administrators, displays information about all accounts in database

My contributions include:
+ created the login page
+ used sha-256 to hash passwords (no salting)
+ contributed to the css page
+ added error checking on the account creation page
  - accounts are created with an accepted role, email, password, and an associated first and last name
+ added in error checking on the account editing page
  - user must enter the same password twice

### [Hangman Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Hangman)

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB via a game of hangman. The project was worked on with @ashiggles as part of a software engineering class. Some of the technical challenges I faced with this project included keeping a list of guessed letters, checking for a win condition, and displaying a high scores table which contains scores for words of the same lengths (which required the use of sessions).
Features of the game include:
+ an index page which asks the user for their name
  - the name is stored in a session and put into the high scores table if applicable
+ a hangman game
  - displays number of letters in a word
  - displays incorrect guessess
  - informs user if they have already chosen a letter
  - informs user of the word at the end of the game
+ a high scores page
  - uses information from a database to display previous game information
    * displays entered username, number of guesses, and word length
+ allows user to play again
