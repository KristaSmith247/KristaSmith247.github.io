I am currently a computer science student pursuing a Bachelor's degree. I started programming in 2020, and have since earned an Associate of Science degree. 

## List of Projects
### [Four In a Row Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/FourInARow)
I created a four-in-a-row game using React. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React, and how a user would be able to interact with the frontend. Since this was my first React project, most of my focus was on learning how it worked. This game allows for two players to choose spots on the board until a player gets four spots in a row. The code checks if a spot has already been filled, and doesn't allow a user to reuse the same spot. It checks for wins diagonally, vertically, and horizontally. Some of the technical challenges I had to overcome included figuring out how to use React to alternate between players.

### [Banking App](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Banking-App)
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create a website. This was a group project done for a software engineering class with @ashiggles and @anniecroft using the name "Team Gecko". The project is a mock banking website, with a login page that directs to a user's account. The user may transfer money between types of accounts, make withdrawals and deposits, update their account information, and view account history. I : + created the login page + used sha-256 to hash passwords (no salting) + contributed to the css page
I also added in error checking on the account creation page to ensure the accounts are created with an accepted role, email, password, and an associated first and last name. I added in error checking on the account editing page to ensure the user enters the same password twice. Some of the technical challenges of this project included establishing communications between the client and server sides.
