## List of Projects
### [Four In a Row Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/FourInARow)
I created a four-in-a-row game using React. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React, and how a user would be able to interact with the frontend. Since this was my first React project, most of my focus was on learning how it worked rather than any in-depth challenges. This game allows for two players to choose spots on the board until a player gets four spots in a row. The code checks if a spot has already been filled, and doesn't allow a user to reuse the same spot. It checks for wins diagonally, vertically, and horizontally. Some of the technical challenges I had to overcome included figuring out how to use React to alternate between players.
