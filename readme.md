I am currently a computer science student pursuing a Bachelor's degree. I started programming in 2020, and have since earned an Associate of Science degree.

## List of Projects

### [Banking App](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Banking-App)
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create a website. This was a group project done for a software engineering class with <a href="https://github.com/ashiggles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ashiggles</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Acroft96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Acroft96</a> using the name "Team Gecko". The project is a mock banking website. Some of the technical challenges of this project included establishing communications between the client and server sides and creating events for when the user hits "submit". See [Banking App](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Banking-App) for more information including features and screenshots.

### [Hangman Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Hangman)

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB via a game of hangman. The project was worked on with <a href="https://github.com/ashiggles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ashiggles</a> as part of a software engineering class. Some of the technical challenges I faced with this project included keeping a list of guessed letters, checking for a win condition, and displaying a high scores table which contains scores for words of the same lengths (which required the use of sessions). See [Hangman Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Hangman) for more detailed information.

### [Four In a Row Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/FourInARow)
I created a four-in-a-row game using React. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React, and how a user would be able to interact with the frontend. Technical challenges included figuring out how to use React to alternate between players, check if a spot was already taken, and display X's and O's for users. See [Four In a Row Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/FourInARow) for more detailed information.
