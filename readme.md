### Aspiring Software Engineer

I am currently a computer science student pursuing a Bachelor's degree. I started programming in 2020, and have since earned an Associate of Science degree. 

## List of Projects

### [Banking App](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Banking-App)
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create a website. This was a group project done for a software engineering class with <a href="https://github.com/ashiggles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ashiggles</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Acroft96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Acroft96</a> using the name "Team Gecko". The project is a mock banking website. Some of the technical challenges of this project included establishing communications between the client and server sides and creating events for when the user hits "submit". See [Banking App](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Banking-App) for more information including features and screenshots.

### [Hangman Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Hangman)

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of React, Node.js, Express and MongoDB via a game of hangman. The project was worked on with <a href="https://github.com/ashiggles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ashiggles</a> as part of a software engineering class. Some of the technical challenges I faced with this project included keeping a list of guessed letters, checking for a win condition, and displaying a high scores table which contains scores for words of the same lengths (which required the use of sessions). See [Hangman Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Hangman) for more detailed information.

### [Hello MERN](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/HelloMERN)
The purpose of this project was to create a GitHub repository which could be accessed by other group members. The project reads a value out of a database and displays it in a React frontend. It uses Node.js, MongoDB, React, and Express.

### [MERN and Sessions](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MERN-Sessions)
This project served as an introduction to using sessions. It built on the [RESTful API](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/RESTful%20API) assignment, and made a frontend for those routes. The user made view, edit, and delete accounts for a mock banking website. This was a solo project.

### [RESTful API](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/RESTful%20API)
The purpose of this project was to create backend routes for mock bank accounts. The goal was to be able to create and edit new accounts. The project utilized Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The challenging aspects of this included figuring out how to access an individual account using an id as well as learning about the different HTTP methods and when they are best used.

### [Four In a Row Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/FourInARow)
I created a four-in-a-row game using React. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React, and how a user would be able to interact with the frontend. Technical challenges included figuring out how to use React to alternate between players, check if a spot was already taken, and display X's and O's for users. See [Four In a Row Game](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/FourInARow) for more detailed information.

### [Node/Express Site with File Storage](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/NodeExpressWebsite)
The purpose of this project was to create a basic website using Node.js and Express. Technical challenges of this project included creating a file to store user input, creating a form for user input, and working with backend routes. See  [Node/Express Site with File Storage](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/NodeExpressWebsite) for more detailed information.

### [MyExpressApp](https://github.com/KristaSmith247/KristaSmith247.github.io/tree/main/MyExpressApp)
This was an assignment that focused solely on Express. It was meant to demonstrate that I could set up an environment which ran Express. It did not have any technical challenges.
