This application is designed to help someone learn a language. It is a full-stack application which uses MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. Some of the challenges I faced with this included designing a program that would be efficient, user friendly, and reducing redundant code. 
Overall features of the website include:
+ account creation
  - unique username required
  - user must enter password twice
  - password is hashed when account is created
+ login page
  - account verification
+ user account page
  - each account has an account type which will determine vocabulary lists
  - user can choose to show/hide either Spanish or English translations
  - user may also focus on studying only verbs
